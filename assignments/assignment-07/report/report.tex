	\section{Canceling tasks}
	We wanted to implement a method of gracefully canceling a task.
	For example, when working on the \emph{Manage proposal} task, a user might wish to cancel managing the proposal.
	We have attempted to include a cancellation action, but have not been able to get this to work nicely with the workflow framework.
	We tried returning various values, such as \lstinline|return ()|, \lstinline|throw "Cancel"|, and have tried changing the return type, as well as ending with an interaction task (\lstinline|viewInformation "Success" [] "Cancelled"|), but these either do not achieve the desired effect, or simply crash the iTasks GUI.
	In the current version 2017-11-08 nightly version of iTasks, the ``Close"-button supplied by the iTasks worklist framework also crashes the GUI.
	As such, we assume there is a bug in the current iTasks version that prevents such buttons from working as intended.
